# NewVMBasicProgInstall
Installing prerequisite set of bioinformatics software.

The method uses conda/bioconda for as much as possible and only performs a native install where the package is not available via bioconda. This was designed by Jason Bramwell (jb2cool)


Step 1 : wget https://github.com/APHA-AMR-VIR/NewVMBasicProgInstall/blob/main/installviaconda.sh
